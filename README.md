# Security Automation Scripts

This repository contains security automation scripts developed as part of an
academic examination in *Shellscripting and Automation with Python*.

The project demonstrates how automation can be used to improve security
baseline checks, reduce manual work, and increase consistency in IT
security operations.

## Included Scripts

### Linux – Bash
**File:** `linux_baseline.sh`  
Performs basic security baseline checks on Linux systems, including:
- Patch and update status
- SSH hardening controls
- Structured logging for later analysis

### Windows – PowerShell
**File:** `windows_baseline.ps1`  
Automates security-related checks on Windows systems, such as:
- Security configuration validation
- Event log inspection
- Privileged account controls

### Cross-platform – Python
**File:** `pythonanalyze_baseline.py`  
Processes and analyzes log output generated by the scripts and produces
a summarized security assessment.

## Security Framework Alignment
The automation approach aligns with commonly used security frameworks:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- NIS2 Directive
